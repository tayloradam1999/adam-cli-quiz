```adam-cli-quiz``` is a command line game that quizzes the user on a series of questions based around [Adam Taylor](https://github.com/tayloradam1999)'s programming taste.

## Usage
In your command line, enter the following command to start the game:
```
npx adam-cli-quiz
```
This only works because I uploaded the package to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/adam-cli-quiz) and added it to my package.json.
